                        <p>Commercial and Industrial solar systems are specifically designed based on a businessâ€™s energy consumption and/or available space to install PV panels/modules. Commercial system design review includes large and small scale systems. While some commercial system might have rooftops are typically metal constructions with much sun exposure, others could be limited and it may not be profitable to install solar panels on the entire roof where we suggest clients to utilize parking lot space through the construction of parking canopies/carport design,</p>
